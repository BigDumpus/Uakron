type(words) #wow is this type checking
#wow this probably isnt what he meant

# Implement universally quantified types, type abstraction,
# and type application. Implement type application during type
# checking, so that the evaluated AST does not contain any type
# abstractions or type applications.

# okay i hope bad rambling py files that dont do anything make him not feel sad
# because he is going away forever and i didnt make a reference to
# escape from new york once despite my eyepatch

# universally quantified types: somthing somthing haskell
# the V thing that means for all
#for all int have type int

# type abstraction: type operation, value. abstract not concreate remove complexity
# so its what python does? i dont know if not needing to define types means
# type abstraction is occuring.

# type application: apply a type.

# so its going to be like the type for the language will be abstracted and the
# type checking happens behind the scences(geez) for the user. so maybe like python

# okay now i just need to grow an AST that does not contain abstrations or applications
# of the type. also do the thing before that

# Implement type application during type checking
# AST contains no abstration or type applications

#why did i do this to myself

# def whattype(object)
# if type(object) is int:
# return int
# if type(object) is bool:
#return bool
